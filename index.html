                "There once was a group of friends that lived in a tree. One St Paddy's day they had a big party... it got a little out of hand. In the morning the Happy Adventure Friends woke up, whilst trying to break out of their stupour, they came to find that their
                friend Mimo the Monkey is missing!! :( Feeling quite under the weather they all tried to decide who was fit enough to go out for a search and rescue mission.
                <br><br> Your mission is to find Mimo....and bring him home safely!!"
